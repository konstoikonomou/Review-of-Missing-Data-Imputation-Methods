# **Review of Missing Data Imputation Methods**

Missing data problem has been recognized as a major issue, since it affects the validity of datasets and surveys. Since every collection of data aims to collect information, a dataset with missing values can restrict our conclusions and findings.

As missing data imputations appears to be a demanding task, both methodologically and computationally, the purpose of this thesis is to review a number of missing data imputation methods. The methods that have been examined include simple traditional imputation methods, such as mean imputation or k-nearest neighbours, as well as more advanced methods, such as clustering methods and frequency distribution.

The imputation methods have been applied to the daily data of electrical load for Nea Elvetia in Thessaloniki, Greece, for the year 2011, as well as daily data of wind speed for the city of Volos, Greece, for the years 2018-2020.

The methods are applied to these datasets and are then compared based on prediction accuracy, deviation percentage and execution time.

The programming part of the study was implemented in Matlab.
